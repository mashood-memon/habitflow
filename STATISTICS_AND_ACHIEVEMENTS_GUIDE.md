# HabitFlow Statistics and Achievements Guide

## Statistics Calculations

### Overview
HabitFlow tracks your progress through various statistics that help you understand your habit-building journey. Here's how each statistic is calculated:

### 1. Daily Progress
- **What it shows**: Percentage of today's habits completed
- **How it's calculated**: (Completed habits today √∑ Total active habits for today) √ó 100
- **Example**: If you have 4 habits scheduled for today and completed 3, your daily progress is 75%

### 2. Current Streak
- **What it shows**: Your longest ongoing streak across all habits
- **How it's calculated**: 
  - Counts consecutive days of habit completion
  - Resets to 0 if you miss a day
  - Shows the highest current streak among all your habits
- **Example**: If you completed "Exercise" for 5 days straight, your current streak is 5 days

### 3. Weekly Score
- **What it shows**: Average completion rate over the last 7 days
- **How it's calculated**: 
  - Looks at all habit completions in the past 7 days
  - Calculates: (Total completions √∑ Total possible completions) √ó 100
- **Example**: If you had 28 possible completions this week and completed 22, your weekly score is 79%

### 4. XP (Experience Points)
- **What it shows**: Total experience points earned from completing habits
- **How it's calculated**:
  - Daily habit completion: 10 XP
  - Maintaining a streak: +2 XP per day in streak
  - Weekly habit completion: 15 XP
  - Completing all daily habits: +5 bonus XP
- **Example**: Complete a daily habit (10 XP) + 3-day streak bonus (6 XP) = 16 XP total

### 5. Level System
- **What it shows**: Your current level based on total XP
- **How it's calculated**: Level = floor(sqrt(Total XP / 100)) + 1
- **Level Requirements**:
  - Level 1: 0-99 XP
  - Level 2: 100-399 XP
  - Level 3: 400-899 XP
  - Level 4: 900-1599 XP
  - And so on...

### 6. Heat Map
- **What it shows**: Visual representation of your daily activity over the past 12 weeks
- **How it's calculated**:
  - Each day shows completion intensity (0-4 scale)
  - 0 = No completions (light gray)
  - 1 = 1-25% completion (light green)
  - 2 = 26-50% completion (medium green)
  - 3 = 51-75% completion (darker green)
  - 4 = 76-100% completion (darkest green)
